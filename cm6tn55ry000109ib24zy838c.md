## 📌 Labels and Selectors in Kubernetes

### Labels 🏷️

Labels are key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects like pods, services, and deployments. They help organize and group resources based on criteria that make sense to you.

**Examples of Labels:**

* `environment: production`
    
* `type: backend`
    
* `tier: frontend`
    
* `application: my-app`
    

### Selectors 🔍

Selectors filter Kubernetes objects based on their labels. This is incredibly useful for querying and managing a subset of objects that meet specific criteria.

**Common Usage:**

* **Pods**: `kubectl get pods --selector app=my-app`
    
* **Deployments**: Used to filter the pods managed by the deployment.
    
* **Services**: Filter the pods to which the service routes traffic.
    

### Labels vs. Namespaces 🌍

* **Labels**: Organize resources within the same or across namespaces.
    
* **Namespaces**: Provide a way to isolate resources from each other within a cluster.
    

### Annotations 📝

Annotations are similar to labels but attach non-identifying metadata to objects. For example, recording the release version of an application for information purposes or last applied configuration details etc.

## 🛠️ Static Pods

Static Pods are special types of pods managed directly by the `kubelet` on each node rather than through the Kubernetes API server.

### Key Characteristics of Static Pods:

* **Not Managed by the Scheduler**: Unlike deployments or replicasets, the Kubernetes scheduler does not manage static pods.
    
* **Defined on the Node**: Configuration files for static pods are placed directly on the node's file system, and the `kubelet` watches these files.
    
* **Some examples of static pods are:** ApiServer, Kube-scheduler, controller-manager, ETCD etc
    

### Managing Static Pods:

1. **SSH into the Node**: You will gain access to the node where the static pod is defined.(Mostly the control plane node)
    
2. **Modify the YAML File**: Edit or create the YAML configuration file for the static pod.
    
3. **Remove the Scheduler YAML**: To stop the pod, you must remove or modify the corresponding file directly on the node.
    
4. **Default location**": is usually `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/`; you can place the pod YAML in the directory, and Kubelet will pick it for scheduling.
    

## 🧭 Manual Pod Scheduling

Manual scheduling in Kubernetes involves assigning a pod to a specific node rather than letting the scheduler decide.

### Key Points:

* Node Name Field: Use this field in the pod specification to specify the node where the pod should run.
    
* **No Scheduler Involvement**: When `nodeName` is specified, the scheduler bypasses the pod, and it’s directly assigned to the given node.
    

```bash
k get po -n kube-system | grep schedular
docker exec -it cka-cluster3-control-plane bash
k run nginx --image=nginx
k get po
k describe pod/nginx
```

### Modify Nginx Pod

```bash
docker exec -it cka-cluster3-control-plane bash
k delete pod nginx
k run nginx --image=nginx -o yaml > nginx.yaml
k delete pod nginx
```

## Nginx yaml

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: nginx
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
  nodeName: cka-cluster3-worker
```

```bash
docker exec -it cka-cluster3-control-plane bash
```

# Working with Static Pods

```bash
cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
ls -lrt
mv kube-scheduler.yaml /tmp
```

# Second Terminal

```bash
k apply -f nginx.yaml
k get pods
k get po -o wide
```

# First Terminal

```bash
mv kube-scheduler.yaml /tmp
ls
```

# Redis Example

### redis.yaml:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: redis
    tier: backend
  name: redis
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redis-container
```

```bash
k apply -f redis.yaml
k get pods
k get pod --selector tier=backend
```
