A #DevSecOps engineer is in charge of ensuring the security of the [**software development process**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/), which [includes automated scanning,](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/) code verification, and defining security policies. In this role, youâ€™ll collaborate with operations and development teams to ensure that security is built into the program from the start and that the software environment is constantly monitored and safe. The following processes are implemented by DevSecOps engineers as follows.

* The first stage is initiated with #**Planning**, where engineers strategically plan and aim for success[ful implementation.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/)
    
* [The next](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/) stage is #**Development**, where the engineers in the team gather valuable sources to provide guid[ance and establish a code re](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/)view system to enhance uniformity.
    
* Then in the #**Building stage**, through tools, the source code is combined with machine code. These automa[ted tools have multiple UIs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/) and some of them can replace the vulnerable files with new ones.
    
* Then in the #**testing stage**, the automated testing framework undergoes some testing practices in the pip[eline.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/)
    
* [In the next stage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/) i.e. **Deployment** where the engineers automate the process and increase the pace of sof[tware delivery through IaC t](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/)ools.
    
* The next stage is **Operation** which is one of the crucial steps and periodic maintenance is a frequent ac[tivity in operation teams.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/)
    
* The s**caling stage** is also one of the important steps where engineers ensure that the organizations do n[ot have to waste their resou](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-process/)rces to maintain large data centers.
