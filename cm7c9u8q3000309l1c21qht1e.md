Replication Controllers serve several important purposes:

1. **High Availability**
    

* Ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times
    
* If a pod fails, crashes, or is deleted, the RC automatically creates a new pod to maintain the desired count
    
* This helps prevent application downtime
    

2. **Load Balancing & Scaling**
    

* Distributes application load across multiple pod instances
    
* Allows horizontal scaling by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas
    
* Can handle increased traffic by running multiple copies of your application
    

3. **Rolling Updates**
    

* Enables basic rolling updates to your applications
    
* Can gradually replace old pods with new ones
    
* Though Deployments handle this much better with additional features
    

4. **Self-Healing**
    

* Continuously monitors the health of pods
    
* Automatically replaces unhealthy pods
    
* Reschedules pods if a node fails
    

However, it's important to note that Deployments are now the recommended way to manage pods in Kubernetes because they offer additional benefits like:

* Better rolling update mechanisms
    
* Rollback capabilities
    
* More flexible update strategies
    
* Version tracking
    

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: myapp-rc
  labels:
    app: frontend
    type: development
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: alpha
        image: nginx
```

```bash
k apply -f rc.yaml
k get pods
```

kubectl get replicationcontroller

```bash
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
myapp-rc   3         3         3       31s
```

**if we make 3 replicas how we add more 2 replicas ?**

**Use kubectl scale Command**

Instead of editing the YAML file, you can use the kubectl scale command to quickly scale the number of replicas.

**For Replication Controller:**

```bash
kubectl scale replicationcontroller <rc-name> --replicas=5
```

**For Deployment:**

```bash
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=5
```

kubectl get replicationcontroller

```bash
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
myapp-rc   5         5         5       18m
```

**If We Delete replicationcontroller**

```bash
k delete replicationcontroller myapp-deployment
```
