Kubernetes is a powerful open-source platform for managing containerized applications. It provides a way to deploy, scale, and manage applications across multiple clusters of computers.

In this blog post, we will explain the architecture of Kubernetes. We will also discuss the different components of Kubernetes and how they work together.

# Kubernetes Architecture

### The control plane
It is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster. The control plane includes components such as the API server, the scheduler, the controller manager, and etcd.
### The worker nodes 
They are also known as minions or agents. Worker nodes run a set of processes that communicate with the control plane. These processes include the kubelet, the kube-proxy, and the container runtime.
