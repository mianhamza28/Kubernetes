# Understanding Kubernetes Requests & Limits 🚀🔧

Welcome to the Kubernetes Requests & Limits guide! This document complements our video explaining managing resource allocation in your Kubernetes cluster. Let’s explore the essentials of Requests and Limits, why they matter, and how to use them effectively.

## 🏙️ What's the Deal with Requests & Limits?

Think of your Kubernetes cluster as a bustling city and pods as tenants in an apartment building. Each tenant (pod) requires specific resources like CPU and memory to function:

- **Requests**: This is the minimum amount of resources a pod needs to operate smoothly. Think of it as a guaranteed reservation for the pod.
- **Limits**: This is the maximum amount of resources a pod can use. It acts as a safety cap to prevent any pod from consuming more than its fair share and disrupting others.

## 🧐 Why are Requests & Limits Important?

- **Resource Control**: By setting limits, you prevent a single pod from monopolizing resources, which can lead to issues like out-of-memory (OOM) kills or CPU starvation. ☠️ Why OOM can be a good thing? Because it kills the pod; otherwise, the container would have consumed all the memory and could kill the node. Killing the pod is a better option than killing a node itself.
- **Predictability**: Requests help the scheduler allocate resources efficiently and ensure pods have the necessary resources to run effectively.

## 🔍 Exploring Resource Management in Action

In our video, we demonstrated some practical examples using YAML files and Kubernetes commands:

1. **Exceeding Available Memory**:
   - A pod requesting more memory than is available will be killed due to an OOM (Out of Memory) error.
